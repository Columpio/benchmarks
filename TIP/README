This archive contains the TIP benchmarks, converted into SMTLIB format
version 2.6. All polymorphism has been eliminated from the problems,
in a possibly incomplete manner.

The benchmarks are organised into the following subdirectories:
* prod - from Productive Use of Failure in Inductive Proof, Ireland & Bundy
* isaplanner - test problems from the IsaPlanner project
* tip2015 - the new TIP benchmarks
* grammars - proving unambiguity of context-free grammars
* false - false properties for benchmarking of counterexample-finding tools
