# TIP: Tons of Inductive Problems

This repository contains benchmarks and challenge problems for inductive
theorem provers.

The benchmarks are in WhyML under the
`benchmarks/` directory and its subdirectories.
Each file contains exactly one problem.

The `original` directory contains the original Haskell source
files for many of the problems. This translation process
is automated with the script `create.sh` and requires
`hipspec` installed from the
[`print-why3`](https://github.com/danr/hipspec/tree/print-why3) branch.

## Contributing to the TIP benchmarks

Contributions are most encouraged! Any inductive problem,
big or small, simple or difficult is welcome.

The simplest method to add new benchmarks is via a github
[pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)
to this git repo.

You are also free to email the maintainers with new problems (or questions):
